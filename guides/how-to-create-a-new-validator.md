# Creating a new validator in Cyberd

## WARNING: This technique should only be used in **testnet**. NEVER follow these instructions in **mainnet**. You would lose all your delegators and reputation.

Imagine that you have been jailed and that you are in buggy testnet like `euler-4`. This was my case. And I was being the most jailed validator in history, spending more time in jail than `The Shawshank Redemption`'s protagonist.

Imagine you are in this desperate situation or maybe some other one I cannot think of, the point being: you need/want to create a new validator. 

How do you that?

Well, in this mini-guide I hope to show you how to do this in a simple manner (thank you Save The Ales for showing me the wisdom).

1. Go to you cyberd folder located in the root directory.
```
cd /cyberd
```
This is where the cyberd docker container is taking the information from. Basically, the files that determine our validator's identity are `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json`. 

2. Making sure that we create a new validator.
If now we run
```
docker exec cyberd cyberd tendermint show-validator
```
and write down our validator identifier (should start with `cybervalconspub`), we will be sure that we are creating a new validator.

3. Remove the `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` files.
In my case I just changed their name.
```
mv daemon/config/node_key.json daemon/config/node_keyold.json
mv daemon/config/priv_validator_key.json daemon/config/priv_validator_keyold.json
```

4. Restart the docker container.
```
docker restart cyberd
```
It will take a little while until you can connect again with the `cyberdcli`.
You can check when the cli is avaliable again using `docker exec cyberd cyberdcli status` repeatedly. It doesn't take too long.

5. Check your new validator's pubkey!
```
docker exec cyberd cyberd tendermint show-validator
```
If everything went well you should have now a new validator pubkey and are ready to create your fresh new validator.
Nevertheless, I would keep the old `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` in some backup folder just in case.

6. Create your new validator.
Just like you created the old one, do 
```
docker exec -ti cyberd cyberdcli tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=10000000cyb \
  --min-self-delegation "1000000" \
  --pubkey=<your_node_pubkey> \
  --moniker=<your_node_nickname> \
  --trust-node \
  --from=<your_key_name> \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --chain-id=<testnet_chain_id>
```
and <em>voilÃ !</em> You have your new validator running.

You can check it with 
```
docker exec cyberd cyberdcli query staking validator <cybervaloper...>
```
and see those wonderful `Jailed: false` and `Status: Bonded`  ðŸ¤©
